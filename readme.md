# Test automatization for online store 

In this repository, automatization smoke test suite can be found. 
Smoke test suite is created for the following website: http://automationpractice.com/index.php
Website is presenting an online store, primarily for clothing. 

## About test cases 

Registration-test is taking valid data from user and creating new account.
This test has to be done first, since user cannot purchase anything on the website 
if he/she is not signed in. 
E-mail that is used for user to register is stored in storedata.cvs file
in order to be reused in other test cases. 

Other tests are checking item purchase flow using search bar, menu and homepage.
Meaning that user is able to add an item to the cart in these three ways.

## Technologies
